        <h1>Module 1 Journal Entry</h1>
        <h2>04/09/2022</h2>
        <p><b>In the past, have you enjoyed research or is it something you dislike? Why?</b></p>
        <p>I almost always enjoy doing research, especially when on topics of my own choice. By choosing topics that I enjoy, I can alleviate a lot of the fatigue I get from working on projects for a long time.  I typically just listen to music and follow the topics where they lead me. This means I can pretty easily get into both writing and research flow state.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite topics to research is machine learning just because it can be applied in so many ways, that it's almost always an applicable and interesting topic. I figured it would be an especially hard topic for this project however, because if I wanted something measurable I would have to really jump into some deep topics, and aside from common ML exam-le problems, you have to start developing your own datasets, and then I'd have to learn about hot to get good generalization. Ultimately, it becomes a rabbit hole, that includes a lot of advanced concepts and it would require me to learn a lot about implementing ML libraries into python. Also, I probably would have a few failed experiments before I really got anything workable.</p>
        <p>Instead, I decided to go with account security. It's honestly because I enjoy trying out all the cracking softwares and learning about it because it is a very deep subject that has a lot of breadth. I get to do research into the various types of attacks that are possible, whether social engineering, statistical, and whatnot. It's also all grounded in reality, meaning most things you learn are based on concrete fact and can be directly applied, whereas a lot of other fields you end up with more abstract recommendations and results. How do you keep your accounts secure? You just research how accounts are typically attacked.</p>
        <p>I hope this topic works out well, because it's always great to write on subjects you find interesting and learn about the things you wanted to learn more about. Hopefully I'm able to do a pretty good deep dive into the subject.</p>
