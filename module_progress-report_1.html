        <h1>Module 1 Progress Report</h1>
        <h2>04/08/2022</h2>
        <p>My project topic I am planning on is account security, where I will identify the types of attacks that are important to mitigate and how to do so. I plan on trying rudimentary hacking and experimenting with multiple cracking approaches and utilities. I will also research two-factor authentication methods and their benefits (especially biometric). I also think that single sign on (SS0) will be an important area to cover.</p>
        <p>I have started by doing some research into cracking and hashing. I have installed some cracking related software (the newest versions of hashcat and hashcatGUI). I have found some research and data though I should look into academic/peer-reviewed sources as well (though I’ve only done basic research so far). I don’t know that I should be any further in my research journey so far, as I’ve barely even started. I plan on using some rainbow tables, of which I found some on https://project-rainbowcrack.com. A lot of rainbow table research will be looking at what passwords are vulnerable to this type of attack (instead of first hand use). I also found some lists of good wordlists to use, including ones from real world security breaches.</p>
        <p>The only issue I’m having is coming up with is a concise way of defining my research scope. I think doing some more basic research and just thinking it over will help give me an idea of what I want to cover. I also enjoy researching security stuff a lot of the time, so I don’t mind doing a bit more research than necessary</p>
        <p>I made enough progress to not be concerned, though of course I have no possible comparisons.</p>
        <p>I expect to do more research as well as discuss my project with my advisor, which should help me get oriented.</p>
